This is a React TypeScript project for a Graph Algorithm Visualizer built with Vite. The project focuses on:

## Key Features:
- Interactive canvas-based graph creation and editing
- Implementation of shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
- Beautiful gradient UI design with modern styling
- Step-by-step algorithm visualization with animation controls
- Real-time graph manipulation (add/delete nodes and edges)
- Multiple example graphs for testing different algorithms

## Code Standards:
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement React functional components with hooks
- Use Canvas API for graph rendering
- Maintain clean separation between UI logic and algorithm implementations
- Follow modern React patterns and best practices
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

## Architecture:
- `/src/components/` - React UI components
- `/src/algorithms/` - Algorithm implementations
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for graph management
- `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions

When implementing features, prioritize code readability, performance, and user experience.
